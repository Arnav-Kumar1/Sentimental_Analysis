Sentiment Analysis Project on Twitter Comments

Introduction: This project aims to classify Twitter comments into
different sentiments using a One vs Rest classifier along with Linear
Support Vector Classification (SVC). The dataset used for training and
testing the model consisted of Twitter comments and their corresponding
sentiment labels.

Data:

The dataset used for this project consisted of Twitter comments and
their corresponding sentiment labels. The comments were collected from
Twitter and labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. Model:

A One vs Rest classifier along with Linear SVC was used to classify the
text into different sentiments. This approach allows for the
classification of multiple classes by training multiple binary
classifiers, one for each class, and then using their decisions to
predict the overall class. Training and Evaluation:

The model was trained on the dataset of Twitter comments and their
corresponding sentiment labels. The model was then evaluated using
metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Performance:

The model achieved an accuracy of 96% on the test dataset. Precision:
87% Recall: 75% Conclusion: The model performed well in classifying
Twitter comments into different sentiments with a high accuracy of 96%.
The precision and recall of 87% and 75% respectively, showed that the
model performed well in identifying true positives and true negatives.
